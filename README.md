# KLRMobile
KLR Mobile app targeted at IOS and Android

This is a working demo of the KLR Mobile application that only has the IOS version completed.

You will more than likely need to install Xamarin tools for Visual studio if you have not.

You will need a Mac or Apple computer to be able to view the demo as it is required to connect into the simluator.

It is currently designed for an Ipad as there are is a lot of information on some screens but it could be modified I am sure to fit on an iPhone with a bit of design changes.

The demo login is: test@tester.com and password is: 123456

---------------------------------

You should be able to be up and running if you have updated nuget and you have a mac to pair it to.

FUTURE WORK
------------

In order to get this app on the store it would first need to be installed to the test flight system:  https://developer.apple.com/testflight/
This will require a valid Apple Developer account to be able to provision it to that demo area.

When the app is ready to go it will need a lot of things to make it pass inspection on the apple store outlined here: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/

ANDROID VERSION
------------
I tried to get a demo running on Android but it looks like it needs a dedicated PC to run it, it wouldn't run in my virtual environment.
